            If I look back from where we have started, All I can see is the Highs and the lows, The Yeses and The Nos. I did several things that broke your hear I broke your trust but believe me I will fix things just give me a chance In Sha Allah. The thing I have to say is If we will not fight on little things then how can we move on by ignoring all those little things You know better than me You are more sensible than I am. Its the little thing which made our bond stronger and different. <br><br>
            I have witnessed you experiencing such amount of pain that one can not be able to bear.. <br>
            You have cried, You tried to harm yourself , You slept with teary eyes you woked up with  swollen eyes this year was full of hurdle full of academics pressure full of homesickness These words can't justice in explaining the pain you have gone through. I Know one thing that these things made  SHEEZA stronger. Dont Underestimate yourself You are far better than anyone else out there I just know this thing.
            <br>
            Your marks I'll ignore I just want to see you winning, I just want to see you saying I have made it as I wanted to, I want to see you calling your father and making him proud that he believed in you and you did it.
            You are NEYAMAT dont forget this. You will always be my favourite Person, You will always be my a person where I will come share things You will always be my a person whom I never want to lose  a person who makes me smile a person whom i can trust a person I will alway put first amongst all, a person I will always have fikr.
