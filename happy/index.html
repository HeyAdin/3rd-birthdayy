            I don't know how you became so much important to me, <br>
            I don't know how I got attached even though I haven't met you but still I can feel your presence. <br>
            I have written something when we were not talking to each other I had no one with whom I can share things except Allah. <br><br>

            <br><br>

In future there will be days where we will fight I'll do something unintentionally that will hurt you But I will always be there for to fix things. I will always be there for you.
