            You know what?? (Here is Phool) <br>
            I am Blessed "Alhamdullilah" Somehow, I've managed to witness your special day for the third time.
            As I said You consider this date to be special So "aur mere pass kya option " Accept krne k alawa.
            not wasting habibti's time Lets get back to our todays topic.
            I know I am using the same technique/method, but In Sha Allah, I will do something better. WHY? Because you deserve it. I know you'll say you don't need/want it, but this person doesn't want to treat you normally. that's it. This person wants to treat you as you deserve to be treated. <br>
